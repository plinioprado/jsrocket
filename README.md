Orbital flight simulator in javascript

The goal is to evolve the features and code. But keep the application simple enough to allow playing not only with the piloting, but also with the modelling and rendering.

There is a secondary goal to explore fundamentals of javascript, that's why the no use of 3rd party packages in the code itself, and some development tools like transpiling and testing.

## Status

The current version is a working protype. Just read the Help instructions.

Most of the current evolution is being made basically in the rendering and breaking down the code in components.

## Getting Started

1. Pull to a folder in your computer.
2. run "$ npm build".
3. Open index.html with Chrome or a compatible browser.
4. Read help.html, available in the 'help' menu option on the top left corner.

## Stack

## Contributing

The code is starting to take it's initial shape, as soon as the code is broken in components it will be open for people to add new ones or new versions of the existing ones.
